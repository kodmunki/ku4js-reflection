Where blocks open the ability to implement closures in C.\r\nAlthough JavaScript already includes this feature, the ability to pass functions across processes and threads may arise\r\nin the implementation of async reflection calls. ku4js-reflection blocks allow the developer to pass functions across\r\nthreads as arguments to async reflection invocations and include \"\\_\\_CALLBACK\\_\\_\" replacements in withing the block.\r\n\r\nBlocks are strings that take the following form:\r\n```javascript\r\n'^([arg1[, arg2[, ...]]]) { /* implementation that may include __CALLBACK__ */ }'\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this, we can see in the following example how a block may be used:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.ku4reflection.invoke(\"$.service\", [], [\r\n    {\"uri\": [\"./\"]},\r\n    {\"onSuccess\": ['^(){  __CALLBACK__; }']},\r\n    {\"onError\": ['^(){ (function() { __CALLBACK__; })(\"ERROR\"); }']},\r\n    \"call\"], function() { console.log(arguments); });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above will attempt to call for the current document. If the call is made over http the callback result will be the\r\ntext of the document. If the call is made over the file system the browser will likely not allow the call.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
